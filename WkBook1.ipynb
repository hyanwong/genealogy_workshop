    "# Genealogical analysis: a very short primer\n",
    "\n",
    "The genomes seen in all organisms on earth have evolved through a progess of inheritance with modification. Modelling the underlying process that creates genomes is a powerful tool for understanding and analysing them. This is the focus of this workbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people are familiar with the idea of a family tree: a genealogy that shows the paths of inheritance between a group of related individuals. We refer to this sort of genealogy as a *pedigree*, avoiding the term \"family tree\", because a pedigree need not be a strictly dividing tree: one individual can be related to another through multiple routes (i.e. rather than a tree, it is a reticulated *network* in which branches can join back to each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "A *genetic genealogy* also describes a network of inheritance, but focusses explicitly on the transmission of DNA. In particular:\n",
    "1. A genetic genealogy must specify the *region* of DNA that is transmitted. Regions of DNA are usually quoted by specifying a left and a right position along a genome of fixed size, e.g. a region from position 10kb to 20kb along chromosome 1.\n",
    "2. At any precise genomic position, inheritance can only come from one parent (i.e. a single DNA letter must have come from the mother or the father, not both)\n",
    "3. A genetic genealogy shows relationships between *genomes*, not individuals. Each individual can contain multiple genomes; most organisms, including humans, are diploid, meaning that they contain two genomes: one maternal and one paternal.\n",
    "4. If mutations are overlaid onto the genealogy, the genomes within it will differ in DNA sequence. Hence coupling genetic genealogies with mutations provides a way to encode genetic variation data (this turns out to be extraordinarily powerful).\n",
    "\n",
    "An entire genetic genealogy showing the network of genetic relationships between a set of genomes (often called the \"samples\"), is sometimes loosely referred to as an Ancestral Recombination Graph, or ARG. Commonly, the sample genomes are taken from the modern day, and the genealogy shows the ancestral relationships between them, over different regions of the genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of point 2. above, these genealogical networks have an amazingly useful property: **at any specific point in the genome** the relationship between the samples can be drawn as a strictly dividing tree. This is sometimes called a \"gene tree\"; a more accurate name is a \"local tree\", because it is specific to a local section of the genome (which might not coincide with the boundaries of a specific gene). If we look along the genome, at a different region, the tree is likely to be different, reflecting the fact that this different section of DNA traces a different path back through history (e.g. via the first sample's grandmother rather than their grandfather). However, parts of the genome that are close to each other along the chromosome are likely to share inheritance paths, and so adjacent trees are often highly *correlated*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to store these genealogical networks, which emphasises that they can also be thought of as a set of correlated trees, is the *succinct tree sequence* format, as implemented in the `tskit` software library."

    "### A duality between branch lengths and site variation\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that the plot above looks pretty similar to the previous ones. That highlights an important point. If most mutations are neutral, and they occur randomly in time, then the number of mutations in a tree is determined by the total branch length in the tree: the more branches, or the longer each branch, the more mutations are likely to be observed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, when mutations are rare, each mutation results in a new variable site. So the proportion of variable sites can be thought of as an estimate of total branch length. In `tskit`, we can switch to this \"branch length\" version of the statistic by using the `mode` parameter, which defaults to `\"site\"` but can be set instead to `\"branch\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the total branch length is a *genealogical equivalent* of the density of variable sites. In `tskit`, both can be obtained using the `segregating_sites()` statistical method, illustrated below:\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note:</b>\n",
    "The segregating sites statistic illustrates a general principle. There is an underlying duality between measures of branch length in local trees and statistics based on genetic variation at individual sites.
